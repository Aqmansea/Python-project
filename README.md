# Python-project
This project is inspired by the Udemy course “Ｗilson 2024 Python全攻略”. It serves as a practical implementation of key concepts covered in the course, including building RESTful APIs with Node.js, working with GraphQL, implementing authentication, and integrating both MongoDB and SQL databases. This project was created as a personal exercise to apply and reinforce the knowledge gained from the course.
